## Introduction

This notebook shows readers how to use `ggforce` package to create parallel sets diagram to show the interaction between 2 categorical variables.

## About demo datasets

All the datasets are available from CRAN or bioconductor.

1. The `Titanic` dataset (from R) provides information on the fate of passengers on the ocean liner ‘Titanic’.
2. The [fission](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/fission.html) dataset provides a `RangedSummarizedExperiment` object of read counts in genes for a time course RNA-Seq  experiment of fission yeast (*Schizosaccharomyces pombe*) in response to oxidative stress at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 mins.
3. The [TENxPBMCData](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/TENxPBMCData.html) single-cell RNA-seq data for on PBMC cells, generated by 10X Genomics.
