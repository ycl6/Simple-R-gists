## Introduction

This notebook shows how to use `readxl` package to retreive the *Monthly COVID-19 Vaccinations* Dataset from
[NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/) and create various plots to show key statistics with `ggplot2`.

## About this dataset

The majority of the figures in this publication provide information on individuals who are eligible for vaccination (those who have an NHS number and are currently alive) who have been vaccinated for     COVID-19 in England or who live in England but have been vaccinated for COVID-19 outside of England.

The publication also includes figures based on all vaccinations administered in England, even if individuals vaccinated are resident outside of England, do not have an NHS number or are no longer alive.

All data in the monthly publication covers vaccinations administered up to midnight of the last day of the previous month.
